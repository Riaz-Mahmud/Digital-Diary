# Digital-Diary

Problem:

A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by
date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal
diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, pictures, comments on
event based on writer's direct experience.

Create a Digital Diary replacing the old hand-written system where person can
store/create his/her event description with date specified. Picture can be added to any
specific event. A person can create multiple events. Home window should display the list
of events that a user has created. A person can modify the existing events and can delete
any specific event from his/her diary. Last Modification date is also recorded in the
system. One unique feature of the system is a user can set the importance (high, moderate,
less important) of any event. Each person can be uniquely identified by the system. After a
successful login his/her diary of events are displayed on home screen.
